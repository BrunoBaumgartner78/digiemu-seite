Optional: Redirects for legacy legal routes

If you still have links to `/imprint`, `/privacy` or `/terms`, consider adding small redirect routes.

Examples:
- Create `src/app/(legacy-legal)/imprint/route.ts` that redirects to `/legal/impressum`.
- Or add Next.js redirects in `next.config.js`.

If you want, I can scaffold the `route.ts` files now — say "redirects" and I'll add them.
